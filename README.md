# Hangzhou Kincony Electronics Co., Ltd. KC868-COL series controller hex protocol documentation v1.1

Based upon a google translation of the Chinese language documentation. The original documentation was provided to me by the [https://kincony.com/forum admin](xuwei@kincony.com).

Note that the KC868-COL series is sold with two different firmware versions, each with different functionality:
- one using the hex based protocol documented here. This version allows setting rules on the KC868-COL to auto control KC868-H series relays.
- one using a text string based protocol. This version does not allow setting rules on the KC868-COL to auto control KC868-H series relays autonomously. It does still allow manual control of KC868-H series relays through the KC868-COL though!

The source document nor the translation are perfect, but this combined with the freely available source to should hopefully enable a proper frontend  implementation.
